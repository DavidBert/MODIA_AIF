# Project assignment

You now have finished the course. Congratulations!  
This class was split in 4 different sections.  
I tried to make the project assignment a combination of the different sections.  
You had to build a recommender system for movies first based on movie Posters and then based on movie plots and provide a webapp to use it.  
This project was supposed to cover the first 3 sections of the course, being the development and deployment of an AI model, recommendation systems and natural language processing.  
The last part of the project is supposed to cover the last section of the course, the explainability of AI models. All the details are provided in the [XAI project](XAI_project.md) page.
  
For the first part of your project, you are suppose to invite me (DavidBert) to a __private Github repository__ that contains all the code and Dockerfiles needed to run your project.  
You are also supposed to provide a Docker compose file that allows to run your project.  
__I do not want to see any dataset, model weights, pickle files or annoy indexes in your repository that weights more than 100MB.  
Instead of that I propose that you store them on a shared Google Drive and use `gdown` within your docker file to download all files need for your application.__  
This means that if you worked correctly on the project, I should be able to run it with a single command: `docker-compose up`.  
If the project is not working, I will not try to fix it, I will just grade it as it is so make sure that it is working before submitting it ;-).  
Concerning the last part of the project, you are supposed to provide a notebook with your code and explanations. The notebook should be self-sufficient, and should be able to be run without to much effort.  
I want to be able to run your notebook directly on Google Colab without modifying it.  

__Finally, the project is due on Mai 3rd at 23:59__
Send me an e-mail when you are done with the link to your repository to verify that everything is ok.
I won't accept any project after the deadline no matter what the reason is so make sure to finish it on time.

Good luck with your exams and good luck with your project!
