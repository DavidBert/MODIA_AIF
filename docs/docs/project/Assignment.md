# Project assignment

You now have finished the course. Congratulations!  
This class was split in 5 different sections.  
I tried to make the project assignment a combination of the different sections.  
You had to build a recommender system for movies first based on movie Posters and then based on movie plots and provide a webapp to use it.  
This project was supposed to cover the first 3 sections of the course, being the development and deployment of an AI model, recommendation systems and natural language processing.  
Since I saw that some of you were still struggling with the deployment part, I decided to ease the second part of the project assignment.
I provided you with a pretrained reinforcement learning agent and you have to build an XAI tool to explain its decisions.
  
For the first part of your project, you are suppose to invite me (DavidBert) to a __private Github repository__ that contains all the code and Dockerfiles needed to run your project.  
You are also supposed to provide a Docker compose file that allows to run your project.  
__I do not want to see any dataset, model weights, pickle files or annoy indexes in your repository that weights more than 100MB.  
Instead of that I propose that you store them on a shared Google Drive provide in your readme file a link to download them.  
I will manually download them and just extract the zip file in the root directory of your project.__  
This means that if you worked correctly on the project, I should be able to run it with a single command: `docker-compose up`.  
If the project is not working, I will not try to fix it, I will just grade it as it is so make sure that it is working before submitting it ;-).  
Concerning the last part of the project, you are supposed to provide a notebook with your code and explanations. The notebook should be self-sufficient, and should be able to be run without to much effort.  
I want to be able to run your notebook directly on Google Colab without modifying it.  

__Finally, the project is due on February 2nd at 23:59 for INSA students and march 3rd at 23:59 for Valdom students.__ (INSA students were supposed to work in groups while Valdom students were supposed to work alone that is why the deadline is different).
Send me an e-mail when you are done with the link to your repository to verify that everything is ok.
I won't accept any project after the deadline no matter what the reason is so make sure to finish it on time.

Good luck with your exams and good luck with your project!
